## Let's get started with Google Cloud

To have the possiblity to access Google cloud I need to setup an environment. To help me I have a sample shell script that I need to run. 

Try running a command now:
```bash
  cd bootstrap/gce_edudevops
  ./bootstrap.sh prefix suffix

**Tip**: Click the copy button on the side of the code box and paste the command in the Cloud Shell terminal to run it.

Replace prefix and digit with to make the project unique,
